    "Just as with a piece of clothing you don't want a ML model to be too loose or too tight. In ML jargon this is known as underfitting or overfitting your model. A model that is overfit is a model that matches the training data almost perfectly but performs poorly on new data. For example, imagine the decision tree below:\n",

I can write the explanation as a way to identify over/underfitting if you want to do an intro? You can just write it and send it to me. Tomorrow I can try and set you up with all the github stuff that needs to be done on the back-end. And just ignore demo stuff. Thanks so much!"
